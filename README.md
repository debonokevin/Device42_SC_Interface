Device42_SC_Interface.ps1 is a Powershell script that I developed to interface between Tenable Security Center Plus and Device42.  This interface is part of the project I executed to deploy Tenable Security Center Plus.  We deployed Tenable Security Center Plus as part of the Zero Trust architecture initiative after I attended the SANS course SEC530: Defensible Security Architecture and Engineering.
